SOFIA Framework [![License][license-img]][license-url]
=
The SOFIA (SOft error Fault Injection Analysis) framework supports fast and early soft error assessment, diagnosis and susceptibility reduction evaluation through the application of software-based mitigation techniques. SOFIA offers a wide range of soft error evaluation opportunities that go beyond the classical toolsets, furthering potential advantages that fill the gap between the available tools and the industry requirements.

## Getting started with the SOFIA framework

SOFIA has two implementations using different simulators. You can access using the links below:
  * Open Virtual Platform simulator (OVPsim) ([sofia-ovp](https://github.com/ManyCoreResearchTeam/SOFIA/tree/main/sofia-ovp)).
  * gem5 simulator ([sofia-gem5](https://github.com/ManyCoreResearchTeam/SOFIA/tree/main/sofia-gem5))
